The basic requirement to use the application would be to create an account, this has been made a basic requirement because any user will be able to search a locality via entering the pin code or provide location access and book a slot in an already existing game in that locality or can create a new game in a locality of their choice where other users can book a slot in the game.
When the user is creating a new game, the user will need to provide a location pin code or location access and the number of people they already have ready to join the game. Once the user provides the necessary information to create a new game, the application will retrieve all the playgrounds near the entered pin code. Once the user selects their preferred ground (via the embedded map), a game is created for that ground and when any other cricketer looks up for that pin code to find a game, they will be showed all the available games for that pin code, and they will be able to select any of the games.
The users who have booked a new game or have joined a new game will be able to see a table of their upcoming games. In this table each game will have a clickable link, which will open apple maps and lead them to the playground. Whenever a game is on that day the user will be alerted with a notification about their upcoming game(s) for the day.
Target Audience
The application is built to suit amateur cricketers who want to find other cricketers in a locality of their choice to play cricket. To be elaborate, the application suits a group of friends who want to play cricket 􏰟􏰧􏰛 􏰡􏰜􏰝􏰪􏰛 􏰔􏰖􏰫􏰕 􏰕􏰝􏰜􏰧􏰬􏰔 cricketers on board to play the game of cricket but are willing to accept anyone else who is interested to play the game.

Competition and Innovation Find a Player
Find a Player is a cross platform application with motto of find players, organize games, and play sports. It consists of a web application, android, and iOS applications. The main market for this application is United Kingdom and Scotland.
  Strengths
   Weakness
 
  1. The application is cross platform, which means that the application is accessible to a larger audience and hence will have a bigger market compared to our market.
2. The application allows the organizers to organize games and attract players to come and join them.
3. This application can also be used by sports clubs to look out for potential players for their club.
4. It allows players with similar interests and levels to connect.
    1. The biggest weakness of this application is that it is currently not available to the Melbourne market. This weakness is a strength for my 􏰖􏰗􏰗􏰘􏰙􏰚􏰖􏰛􏰙􏰜􏰝 􏰖􏰞 􏰙􏰛 􏰡􏰜􏰕􏰞􏰝􏰪􏰛 􏰔􏰖􏰫􏰕 􏰛􏰜 compete with this established application. In this regard my application is better as it designed for Melbourne Market and caters for the need of Melbourne Consumer.
2. This application is available to a large audience, hence finding games can be a bit of hassle as demand will be huge for the available games.
 GAMETREE
GAMETREE is a web application platform, where like-minded online gamers can match (like tinder) based on their preferences, play their choice of computer games. GAMETREE strives to help gamers who want to find other gamers to play with. It also allows the players to even start to start their own party (a group where other players can join if the party meets their gaming preferences).
  Strengths
   Weakness
  1. The application makes use of machine learning to match with other gamers based on their preferences.
2. The application also allows the gamers to link their social media like Facebook and Instagram so that the matched gamers can stay connected in better way.
3. This application also provides personal game recommendations to user based on their activity.
   1. Sometimes the match by ML software may not be so convincing and it would be better if the user could decide with whom they could match and play together. This makes my application better as it allows the user to select what game they want to be part of or if at all they want to select a game.
2. The application is only available as a web application. So not many people would have access to a computer. Hence my application being an iOS application will have edge at getting more audience.
 
Feasibility and Technology
The application will be built on iOS operating system with a dominant focus on iPhones. Some of the important frameworks, techniques and UI Elements that will be used to develop this application are explained in detail below.
1. UI Elements:
1. Text Fields: In-order to capture important details from the users (Eg: email
address, password, name, and other personal information).
2. Labels: These labels will be used to identify different input fields.
3. Button: Buttons are an important UI element for this application, as buttons will
be used to kick-start a method or any other process.
4. Table View: The Table View element will be a useful component to display all the
upcoming booked games, as well as to see the list of all the playgrounds in the
vicinity of the preferred pin code.
5. Map Kit View: This UI element will be used to embed map interfaces into the
application; this map interface will be used to show the list of grounds where the game can be held (each ground location on the map will have pin on the map). Also, this interface will be used by the users to reach the grounds instead of having to use the apple map separ􏰖􏰛􏰕􏰘􏰦 􏰛􏰜 􏰬􏰧􏰙􏰡􏰕 􏰛􏰔􏰕􏰠 􏰛􏰜 􏰛􏰔􏰕 􏰬􏰨􏰜􏰧􏰝􏰡􏰪􏰞 􏰘􏰜􏰚􏰖􏰛􏰙􏰜􏰝􏰤
6. Date Picker: This element will be used to select the date and time (this date and time will the day when user would like to play the game).
7. Core Location Button: This element will be used to obtain current location of the user. After obtaining the location, application will directly show the available grounds near the user instead of having the need to ask 􏰛􏰔􏰕 􏰧􏰞􏰕􏰨􏰪􏰞 􏰘􏰜􏰚􏰖􏰛􏰙􏰜􏰝 􏰕􏰫􏰕􏰨􏰦 time.
2. Frameworks:
Out of the four layers of iOS architecture, the layer which will be predominantly used in the application will be CoCoa Touch. Under this layer following frameworks will be utilized.
1. UIKit: This framework will power our application with basic and important features
like touch-based input, and it will cover all other aspects related to user interface.
2. MapKit: The MapKit framework will allow the application to embed maps directly into the view of the application and importantly it will give our application with a
sense of place with maps and location information.
3. APIs:
In-order to obtain the playgrounds (along with playground􏰪􏰞 􏰙􏰝􏰩􏰜􏰨􏰠􏰖􏰛􏰙􏰜􏰝􏰲 near a location, the following dataset will be used via an API. The dataset can be relied on because the website on which data set was obtained is owned and maintained by the

City of Casey. Once dataset is obtained via an API, the application will perform a filtering operation to provide the list of the nearest playgrounds to the user, along with a brief description about the playground.
Dataset: https://data.casey.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/playgrounds/api/
4. Database Platform:
A database platform will be used to store the data related to the games which have been booked so that other users can look up and book the game if they are interested, this data can be accessed and retrieved from anywhere.
Interface Design and Storyboard Mock-ups
 
                      
In-addition to the interface design and storyboard provided above, the following steps will 􏰟􏰕 􏰛􏰖􏰥􏰕􏰝 􏰛􏰜 􏰕􏰝􏰞􏰧􏰨􏰕 􏰀􏰗􏰗􏰘􏰕􏰪􏰞 􏰯􏰧􏰠􏰖􏰝 􏰃􏰝􏰛􏰕􏰨􏰩􏰖􏰚􏰕 􏰰􏰧􏰙􏰡􏰕􏰘􏰙􏰝􏰕􏰞 􏰱􏰯􏰃􏰰􏰲 􏰙􏰞 􏰩􏰜􏰘􏰘􏰜􏰭􏰕􏰡 􏰖􏰝􏰡 􏰧􏰗􏰔􏰕􏰘􏰡􏰤
Data Entry
 When possible, present choices: To obtain the date and time from the user, a date picker object is used to make data entry efficient
Get information from the system whenever possible: The application will ask the user if they want their email address to be stored while logging in (Login Page). Whenever the user next logins,
 the email address will be prefilled.
Provide reasonable default values: Elements will be prefilled with most plausible values. For example: the date picker object in the Create a Game page will be initialised to current date and time to make it easier and more efficient for the user.
Enable advancement only after collecting required values: The button in a page will only proceed after all the required inputs for that page will be satisfied. For example: in the Create a Game page, all the required details need to be given to ensure the submit button on the page works.
Dynamically validate field values: The text fields will be checked and evaluated dynamically. For example: In the Create a Game page, the number of players text field will be dynamically validated to check if the number meets our requirement.
Ease navigation through value lists: The table in the List of Upcoming Games page will contain
 all the upcoming booked games of the user. This table will be sorted based on the earliest game being first and most late game being at the last.
Notification
 Build trust by accurately representing the urgency of each notification: Relevant interruption levels will be used based on the time remaining for their next game to notify the user of their upcoming games. This will be given high priority to win the trust of the user, do that they rely on the importance of these notifications.
Use the Time Sensitive interruption level only for notifications that are relevant in the moment: Time sensitive interruption will be only used to notify the user when they have an
 upcoming game in <= 1 hour. For all other notifications relevant interruption levels will be adopted.
Accounts
description of reasons why creating/log-in is mandatory.
 Explain the benefits of creating an account and how to sign up. When the user
 launches the application for the first time, the application will provide a brief
 
Scope and Limitations
The following functionalities need to be present in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the application:
1. The Login-In and Sign-Up feature are the most basic and essential. They need to be present in the MVP to create or access a user account.
2. Accessing dataset of Playgrounds via an API is a core feature needed. The plan is to pin all the locations of Playgrounds in a location selected by user in a map and embed the map into the view. In the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) it will be sufficient if all the playgrounds are showed in a table view.
3. The plan is to sort the table containing the upcoming games in the Upcoming Games page based on the earliest date first. But for MVP, the table just needs to contain the upcoming games without any sorting required.
4. For the MVP, the features that will be responsible for making data entry efficient and smoother are not required. For example: The dynamic validation of Number of Players Input is not required 􏰖􏰝􏰡 􏰔􏰕􏰝􏰚􏰕 􏰭􏰜􏰝􏰪􏰛 􏰟􏰕 􏰝􏰕􏰕􏰡􏰕􏰡 􏰙􏰝 􏰛􏰔􏰕 􏰌􏰮􏰁
5. Also in the MVP, a clickable address feature in the Upcoming Games page is not required (this clickable address would open apple maps to guide the user to that specific playground). Instead of this an address will be provided and the user needs to open maps on their own and type in the address.
6. The use of database to store game information is essential as it is accessed by other users (in Selected Playground Page) in-order to book existing games (games created by other users).
The limitation of the application is predominantly because of the dataset obtained via API. Although the website from where the dataset is obtained is reliable, the data sometimes cannot be accessed via API if there some issues with the website. The second limitation is that the current dataset can only accommodate the playgrounds present in Australia, this means a person will be able to create a game for playgrounds present in Australia. In future if the application performs well, this feature will be extended to include playgrounds from other countries as well.
One of the other limitations is that the current dataset (obtained via API) is limited to the playgrounds in the City of Casey Council. So, the number of playgrounds available to select from is limited. This is one of the options that will be kept in mind in case of any future expansions, to include more playgrounds around Australia.
The other limitation is associated to the database. Some of our data will be stored and accessed remotely, accessing the data can be interrupted or delayed if the database is down or under DDoS attack (Directly Denial of Service).
